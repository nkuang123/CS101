; Exercise 1:
; Define the function letter-grade that consumes a number between 
; 0 and 100, and produces a letter grade ("A", "B", "C", "D", "F") 
; using the usual 90, 80, 70, 60 cutoffs. 
 
; Exercise 2:
; Define the function pass? that determines whether the given number
; grade is a passing grade (60 or higher).
 
; Exercise 3:
; Define the function pass-fail that consumes a number grade and 
; determines either "pass" or "fail". Use the pass? predicate function
; from Exercise 2.
 
; Exercise 4:
; Define the function NRO-grade, which consumes a number grade and a 
; minimum numeric grade between 0 and 100, and produces either a 
; letter grade, "PA", or "F", according to Vassar's NRO rules. You
; are encouraged to use one or more functions from Exercises 1-3 as
